## Description

##### Team Members
Viv | Simon | Kane

Project 3 presents a series of new challenges. Among these are our first use of the MERN stack in a project, with the necessity for comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as a fundamental requirement. Additionally, we must adapt to collaborating within a larger team of three members, which entails effectively mastering and navigating GitHub. This experience will not only enhance our technical skills but also our ability to work cohesively as a unit.

## Brief

 I was fortunate to share this project with Simon and Kane. Among us we all shared a passion to collaborate and work effectively. We were able to get on the same page with choices and topics smoothly and as a result it did not take us long to decide on what kind of a project we wanted to work on. A social network like clone for car enthusiasts is what we settled on with an e-commerce website being the alternative. The site “Pedal” would allow users to Add, Comment, Like , Update and Delete Posts as well as Add and Delete cars of their own. Users can add cars that would be able to be viewed on their profile and allow users to Follow others!

## Challenges

	
- Ensuring all changes are correctly pushed and working on the correct branch is a mistake we all made during this project and the learning curve felt a bit more steep. Regardless, the experience we got from making those mistakes really taught me alot . 

- Understanding React and how components work with props was something I attempted to delve into and was able to apply with the modals but was definitely  a challenge the first time around.

- Really got into using SCSS with this project and as all of the team were adding styling to the .scss file making changes without affecting other changes add a new challenge to the project.

## Wins
With how the week progressed . One of our teammates was unwell and needed to recoup for a period of time. And While we were progressing steadily along. When that team-mate got back we were able to move at a pace that without which this project would not be possible. We were able to add a lot more endpoints to the project (more than we would end up using) that allowed us to be able to add the ability to like and follow as well as a search bar. These additional features made traversing the site more linear and made the user feel like they could use the site without using the back button. To me as a team I consider this an awesome win for a first attempt !

## Key Learnings/Takeaways
- To me getting to work on separate computers as a team with GitHub, on branches taught me alot about how versions are controlled during development. Something I felt rather unsure about working with before this project.
- Working with .env files and .gitIgnore to keep sensitive data private - A really important lesson here for me that I'm sure is a must know when working in more professional fields .
- Understanding how to use Cloudinary to manage image uploads via the cloud.

---
## Bugs
- The Video on the start screen on larger screens tends to introduce a vertical scroll in spite of styling changes. This is only evident on pages above xl size on bootstrap. 

---
## Future Improvements
- Would like to correct the Video sizing issue on the landing screen.
- Correct the sizes of the cards and their alignment in grid form on the Home-Feed and on the profile view.
- Centre the cards on the page on small screens.
